% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
  Endgames have a~distinctive role for players.
  At the late stage of~games, many aspects are finally clearly defined, deeming exhaustive analysis tractable.
  Specialised endgame handling is rewarding for games with perfect information (e.g., Chess databases pre-computed for entire classes of~endings, or dividing Go board into separate independent subgames).

  An~appealing idea would be to extend this approach to imperfect-information games such as the famous Poker:
  play the early parts of~the game, and once the subgame becomes feasible, calculate an~ending solution.
  However, the problem is much more complex for imperfect information.

  \emph{Subgames} need to be generalized to account for \emph{information sets}.
  Unfortunately, such a~generalization cannot be solved straightaway, as it does not generally preserve optimality.
  As a~consequence, we may end up with a~far more exploitable strategy.

  There are currently three techniques to deal with this challenge:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item disregard the problem entirely;
    \item use a~decomposition technique, which sadly retains only the same quality;
    \item or formalize improvements of~strategies into a~so-called \emph{subgame margin}, for which we construct a~``gadget'' game, making it the best possible.
  \end{enumerate}

  The last approach is our own result presented at~the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on~Artificial Intelligence in~2016.
  We experimentally compare the three solutions using a~top participant of~the AAAI-14 Computer Poker Competition, the leading playground for agents in~imperfect-information setting.
