In this chapter we will notice how the situation for subgames becomes more delicate within the imperfect-information setting.
A~re-solved subgame strategy can end up being more exploitable:
even if we play a~best response in the subgame, we \textbf{assume the fixed original strategy} in~the trunk of~the game tree.

This is, however, not true since the opponent can distinguish the states within our own information set, which---for us---are indistinguishable.
He can therefore freely change his behavior in~the trunk and manipulate against our best response for his own benefit.

For more illustration, study the example in Section~\ref{sec:intricate-ex}.

To see difficulties with combining a~re-solved subgame strategy with an~original trunk strategy, we will consider \emph{rock-paper-scissors}\footnotemark{} as our running example:

Figure~\ref{fig:game-tree-rock-paper-scissors} displays the extensive form of~rock-paper-scissors:
rather than showing the choices simultaneously, the two players take turns in~picking their action.
However, their decisions are mutually hidden, and revealed only at~the end.

The blue ``bubble'' encircling the 3 acting nodes of player~2 marks his (only) information set $\I_2 = \{R, P, S\}$ (corresponding to the action chosen by~the first player).
This imperfect information represents the fact that he is unaware of~1's preceding choice.
