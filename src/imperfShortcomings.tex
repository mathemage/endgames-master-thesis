In this chapter we will notice how the situation for subgames becomes more delicate within the imperfect-information setting.
A~re-solved subgame strategy can end up being more exploitable:
even if we play a~best response in the subgame, we \textbf{assume the fixed original strategy} in~the trunk of~the game tree.

This is, however, not true since the opponent can distinguish the states within our own information set, which---for us---are indistinguishable.
He can therefore freely change his behavior in~the trunk and manipulate against our best response for his own benefit.
For more illustration, study the example in Section~\ref{sec:intricate-ex} (taken from \cite{BurchJohansonBowling13}).

To see the difficulties of~combining a~re-solved subgame strategy with an~original trunk strategy, we will consider \emph{rock-paper-scissors}\footnotemark{} as our running example:

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:game-tree-rock-paper-scissors} displays the extensive form of~rock-paper-scissors:
rather than showing the choices simultaneously, the two players take turns in~picking their action.
However, their decisions are mutually hidden, and revealed only at~the end.

The blue ``bubble'' encircling the 3 acting nodes of player~2 marks his (only) information set $\I_2 = \{2_R, 2_P, 2_S\}$, where states correspond to the action chosen by~the first player.
This imperfect information represents the fact that he is unaware of~1's preceding choice.

One apparent subgame (recall Definition~\ref{defn:subgame}) of~rock-paper-scissors is the endgame when player~2 picks his choice:
\begin{figure}[H]

  \def\captionTitle{An~(imperfect-information) subgame $S$ of~rock-paper-scissors}
  \captionWithCite{\captionTitle}{BurchJohansonBowling13}
  \label{fig:subgame-rock-paper-scissors}
\end{figure}
\noindent
At the beginning of~subgame~$S$, player~2 resides in~one of~the three states $\I_2 = \{2_R, 2_P, 2_S\}$ depending on~opponent's strategy in the (removed) trunk.
Specifically, the probability of~being in state~$2_R$ equals to 1's probability to~choose rock.
Likewise for states $2_P$ and $2_S$.

It is not enough to~na{\"i}vely re-solve subgame~$S$ with the~assumption of~a~fixed strategy in the trunk:
\begin{claim}[\cite{BurchJohansonBowling13}]
  \label{claim:rps-subgame}
  If subgame $S$ is re-solved with a~fixed trunk strategy, there is an~equilibristic solution (i.e. a~best response against the fixed trunk strategy) that player~1 can exploit, once he is allowed to adjust his strategy in the trunk.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose the initial strategy $\sigma = (\sigma_1, \sigma_2)$ is uniformly random\footnotemark{}.
  Evidently, $\sigma$ is an~equilibrium for the full game of~rock-paper-scissors.
  \footnotetext{Every move is selected with the same probability $\frac{1}{3}$.}

  Now, if we discard the trunk and assume the fixed trunk strategy~$\sigma_1$, player~2 is to be in~any of~the states $\I_2 = \{2_R, 2_P, 2_S\}$ with the equal probability.
  Because of~this, each action results in the same expected utility of~$0$ (e.g. playing rock gives utility $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot (-1) + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 = 0$).
  Hence, it is irrelevant for which strategy player~2 decides, as all strategies produce equally good utilities, and thus, all are best responses to $1$'s strategy\footnotemark.
  \footnotetext{Player~1 has only one possibility, the empty strategy, since he takes no action in subgame~$S$.}

  Player~2 can opt for a~strategy~$\sigma^R_2$ of~\emph{always playing rock}, as it is a~valid best response.
  This would become the equilibristic solution from the statement.
  If player~1 can change his strategy in~the trunk, though, he may naturally exploit the equilibristic solution of~player~2.
  Namely, a~strategy~$\sigma^P_1$ of~\emph{always playing paper} certainly defeats $\sigma^R_2$.
\end{proof}
