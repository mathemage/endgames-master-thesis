In this chapter we will notice how the situation for subgames becomes more delicate within the imperfect-information setting.
A~re-solved subgame strategy can end up being more exploitable:
even if we play a~best response in the subgame, we \textbf{assume the fixed original strategy} in~the trunk of~the game tree.

This is, however, not true since the opponent can distinguish the states within our own information set, which---for us---are indistinguishable.
He can therefore freely change his behavior in~the trunk and manipulate against our best response for his own benefit.
For more illustration, study the example in Section~\ref{sec:intricate-ex} (taken from \cite{BurchJohansonBowling13}).

To see the difficulties of~combining a~re-solved subgame strategy with an~original trunk strategy, we will consider \emph{rock-paper-scissors}\footnotemark{} as our running example:
\footnotetext{a~3-choice extension of~\emph{matching pennies} (Figure~\ref{fig:matching-pennies})}

  \label{fig:game-tree-rock-paper-scissors}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:game-tree-rock-paper-scissors} displays the extensive form of~rock-paper-scissors:
rather than showing the choices simultaneously, the two players take turns in~picking their action.
However, their decisions are mutually hidden, and revealed only at~the end.

The blue ``bubble'' encircling the 3 acting nodes of player~2 marks his (only) information set $\I_2 = \{2_R, 2_P, 2_S\}$, where states correspond to the action chosen by~the first player.
This imperfect information represents the fact that he is unaware of~1's preceding choice.

One apparent subgame (Definition~\ref{defn:subgame}) of~rock-paper-scissors is the endgame when player~2 picks his choice:

  \captionWithCite{\captionTitle}{BurchJohansonBowling13}
  \label{fig:subgame-rock-paper-scissors}
\end{figure}
\noindent
At the beginning of~this subgame, player~2 resides in~one of~the three states $\{2_R, 2_P, 2_S\}$ depending on~opponent's strategy in the (removed) trunk:
the probability of~being in~$2_R$ equals to 1's probability to~choose rock.
Similarly for $2_P$ and $2_S$.
