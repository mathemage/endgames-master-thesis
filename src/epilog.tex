\epigraph{
  Everything that civilisation has to~offer is a~product of human intelligence;
  we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by~the tools that AI may provide, but the eradication of~war, disease, and poverty would be high on~anyone's list.

  Success in~creating AI would be the biggest event in~human history.
  Unfortunately, it might also be the last.
