  Raise your quality standards as~high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on~routine problems, and always try to~work as~closely as~possible at~the boundary of~your abilities.
  Do this, because it is the only way of~discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.
}{Edsger Wybe Dijkstra}
\epigraph{
  The worst thing that can happen in a~democracy---as well as in an~individual's life---is to become cynical about the future and lose hope.
