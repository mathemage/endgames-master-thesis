  In order to improve your game, you must study the endgame before everything else.
  For whereas the endings can be studied and mastered by~themselves, the middle game and opening must be studied in relation to the end game.
}{José Raúl Capablanca}

For many games, solving their late stages (so-called \emph{endgames}) can be done in~an~online way.
In other words, we are often able to postpone the computation of~the endgame strategy until the endgame itself is reached in~the play.

This is especially the case of~perfect-information games such as chess or Go, where the endgame technique has been used for long time.
In these domains, online endgame solving has~significant importance, as it substantially improves the playing quality of~agents.
